	&emsp;I'm Spunky. I've been a photographer for just over two years, starting in early 2022. I strive for a fine look and feel to my photos, inspired by the style of portraits from decades past; I want to make fursuiters look soft, warm, and pretty, just like they are in person.<br><br>
	&emsp;I'm one of the two photographers working on Chasing Tail Magazine, a fursuit pinup and furry entertainment magazine. Outside of the fandom, I'm a part-time professional photographer, focusing on portraiture, cities and countryside, and still life work.<br><br>
	&emsp;My biggest inspirations are pictorialists from the early 20th century, in particular William Mortensen and Rudolf Koppitz; I particularly love how kinetic or stoic their subjects appear, and the way they construct scenes with literal sets or through composition. More contemporary, I look up to ex-Playboy photographer Ken Marcus and his soft-focus erotic portraiture.<br><br>
	&emsp;I personally strive to do everything "honestly" and in-camera. The look and feel, characteristics of, and effects in my photography are accomplished exclusively through lighting, filtration, composition, exposure, darkroom manipulation, and the choice of lens and film stock. I will <u>never</u> use any kind of digital photomanipulation, including any sort of airbrushing, composition, "photoshopping," content-aware fill, AI, or any similar tricks. I want my photography to be and represent honest artwork.<br><br>
